# LaTeX-figures
This is a collection of figures that I created for various class presentations.  A .pdf and a .tex 
file of each will be included & I'll try to have informative file names.

In some cases, the code is clunky because the figures were created early in my LaTeX adventure.  If
you find errors or have suggestions, please let me know!  matthew.e.riehl@gmail.com
